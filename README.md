# MASI-KrippAlpha-R
*Important dev note:* This package is currently under active construction. The code, sample data, and guides provided are for the purposes of enabling individuals to use the code that is already there for research purposes. As such, the code is functional, but not yet refined or complete. For individuals interested in applying the code, please see user guide/User Guide to MASI-MVNA.md

This package is intended as a way for R users to delegate the computation of Multi-Value Krippendorff's Alpha for nominal data to Python's NLTK module - an interrater agreement statistic. In doing so, it bypasses computational and temporal limitations on existing R packages, such as irr (https://cran.r-project.org/package=irr) and krippendorffsalpha (https://cran.r-project.org/package=krippendorffsalpha).

Existing R packages use permutation computations to arrive at Krippendorff's Alpha, which presents issues as the number of coders, possible codes, and data increase, since the number of permutations increase exponentially. However, there are good reasons to want to use Krippendorff's Alpha, not least because it allows for something we call multi-value coding, where the codes applied are not orthogonal to each other. Traditional interrater agreement/reliability statistics require orthogonal coding for computation, but this is often incompatible with various theoretical considerations that researchers make in social science.

To resolve this issue, we employ the use of MASI distances in Python's NLTK module (https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.metrics.masi_distance.html) which was originally developed in 2006 by Rebecca Passonneau (http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2006/pdf/636_pdf.pdf). By using reticulate (https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate) as an interface from R, we make this solution accessible to social scientists who may not have as much expertise/comfort with the use of Python. This solution is inspired by the following stackexchange question and subsequent answer by user andrein: https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/460450.
