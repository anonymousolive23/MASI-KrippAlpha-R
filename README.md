# MASI-KrippAlpha-R
This package is intended as a way for R users to delegate the computation of Multi-Value Krippendorff's Alpha for nominal data to Python's NLTK module - an interrater agreement statistic. In doing so, it bypasses computational and temporal limitations on existing R packages, such as irr and krippendorffsalpha.
